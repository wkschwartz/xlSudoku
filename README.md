Either make a bug report in
[GitHub](https://github.com/wkschwartz/xlSudoku/issues) or make a pull request
in which you edit the *text* files. I will take care of importing the edits to
the text files into the Excel document. (That is, the text files are the
controlling versions; the Excel document is there just for testing.)
